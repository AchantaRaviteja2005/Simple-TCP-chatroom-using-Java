# Simple-TCP-chatroom-using-Java
I've built a simple TCP chatroom to which unlimited users can connect and have a chat in their terminal, *This is an absolute raw TCP chat application made with java.*

1. To run this first download both the files.
2. Run the Server class in a seperate terminal or terminal of any IDE.
3. Open two extra terminals (Powershell/CMD for windows, respective terminal for linux and MacOS).
4. Run the Client class seperatly.
5. That's it you have two Clients sitting in a localhost chatroom, simulating typical two person chatroom experience.

Features/commands:
1. /nick - for changing nickname of Client mid convo
2. /quit - for leaving the convo, this kills the Client class, and displays "[nickname] left the chat" message to all the others.
